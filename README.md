# Data Scientist, Bionics Engineer & Educator

I am a data scientist with Bionics Engineering background and knowledge on machine learning, data analysis and visualization technologies. I am passionate in Artificial Intelligence as a tool to create meaningful solutions to complex problems. Furthermore, I have a curious and creative personality that keeps updated and learning about the current AI landscape and its trends.

## Skills

* Clean, transform, merge and visualize data with Python using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, Plotly, etc...
* Experience with implementing machine learning algorithms (Scikit-learn, PyTorch and TensorFlow) to create clusters, models and to detect underlying patterns in data.
* Develop data pipelines: extract, transform and load (ETL’s).
* Knowledge in SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL and Firebird).
* Conformable in working with version control (GIT).
